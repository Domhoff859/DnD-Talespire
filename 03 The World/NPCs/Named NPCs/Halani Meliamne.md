Halani Meliamne is a princess who was kidnapped and enslaved by the [[Jagddorffolk]]. She is accompanied by two servants named Vandar and Jevin. She wants to return to her folk located in the Moonholt forest.

She belongs to the elven tribe Lai'quendi (the whisperers). The Lai'quendi live in the Moonwood. The tribe is very close to nature and lives in harmony with the elements. They are experienced hunters and magicians. They can also talk to animals and winds.
Fire giants threaten their tribe. Some tribe members flee, others defend their homeland. Halani Meliamne thinks that the giants must be defeated.
