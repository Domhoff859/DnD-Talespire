Available Renovations and Services
Note on Renovation Costs and Times: If the prerequisites for a renovation are met, the initial construction can be done at any level of quality. To upgrade an existing renovation from one level of quality to another, the cost is equal to the difference between the two levels and the time required is halved, rounded down. Unless listed as “upfront,” the cost of a renovation is due upon completion. If the cost is not paid upon completion, the renovation is canceled and the guilds become angry with you.
