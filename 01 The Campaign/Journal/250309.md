The party rescues [[Halani Meliamne]] and her servants. *[[Desmond]] wants to have an affair with the princess.*

[[Sindrir Gerrick|Gremlin]] takes a closer look at the elevator mechanism. Next to the elevator there are stairs that go down.
The elevator is operated by several levers which are all very large as they are designed to be operated by giants. There are three levers: (a) one that turns the elevator on/off; this is in the on position, (b) one to adjust the speed and (c) a lever for an emergency stop.
The levers are decorated with giant runes describing how to operate them.

We hold a long rest which is uneventful.

### Day 185

Gnome arbeiten "gerne" mit Riesen zusammen. Neben der Prinzessin und ihren 2 Dienern haben wir noch 1 Gnome namens Nibwick befreit. Nibwick möchte zurück nach [[Silverymoon]].

The elevator moves for 30 seconds and then stops.

[[Desmond]] goes down the stairs next to the elevator 30 feet. A branching mine shaft begins here. While exploring the branching mine shaft system, [[Desmond]] finds an earth elemental named [[Rocky]].

United as group the party marches down the stairs. We encounter 2 fire elementals, 2 salamander and 3 gnomes.
