If you have Truesight, your vision is enhanced within a specified range. Within that range, your vision pierces through the following:

- **Darkness**. You can see in normal and magical Darkness.
- **Invisibility**. You see creatures and objects that have the Invisible condition.
- **Visual Illusions**. Visual illusions appear transparent to you, and you automatically succeed on saving throws against them.
- **Transformations**. You discern the true form of any creature or object you see that has been transformed by magic.
- **Ethereal Plane**. You see into the Ethereal Plane.
