![[Ring of Jumping.jpg|200]]

**Increased jumping ability**: The wearer of the ring is able to perform **3 times greater jumps** than normally possible. This enables him to overcome obstacles, climb high walls or cross chasms.

**Bonus on jump throws**: The ring often also grants the wearer a bonus to jump throws, meaning that he has a greater chance of successfully executing high jumps, even in difficult conditions.

**Permanent Effect**: The ring's ability is permanent as long as the wearer wears it. There is usually no limited number of uses or time limit for using the enhanced jumping ability.
