## What is Alignment?
Alignment is an extremely simple two-axis system used to describe a creatures’ general "moral attitude". While this doesn’t portray the minutiae of philosophy, it can be a quick shorthand to determine how a creature might behave.
## Law and Chaos
The first axis of Alignment is the “Law vs. Chaos” axis.

Creatures which are “Lawful” tend to be orderly and organized. They often value rules and structure, and therefore value systems which support those ideals: laws, traditions, systems of honor, etc. At its best, being Lawful means honesty, trustworthiness, reliability, and stability. At its worst, being Lawful means being rigid, stagnant, judgemental, and tyranical.

Creatures which are “Chaotic” value freedom and flexibility. They value freedom of choice, individualism, and adaptability. At its best, being Chaotic means a readiness to accept change, to explore new ideas, and to explore new ideas. At its worst, being chaotic means being disorganized, unreliable, irresponsible, and sometimes even destructive.
## Good and Evil
The second axis of Alignment is the “Good vs. Evil” axis.

Creatures which are “Good” tend to be altruistic, generous, and peaceful. Good characters often give of themselves to help others.

Creatures which are “Evil” tend to be selfish, greedy, and sometimes even malicious.

# The Ten Alignments
## Lawful Good
Lawful Good creatures behave as a “good person” is expected to—following rules, respecting legitimate authority, and treating others with kindness, honour, and respect. While this alignment is often associated with idealistic heroes, it is sometimes mocked as “lawful stupid” due to its tendency toward moral rigidity and stubbornness.

## Neutral Good
Neutral Good creatures strive to do what they believe is right, but they aren't as bound to rules or structure as those of the Lawful Good alignment. While they may follow laws or societal norms when it makes sense, they prioritize doing good over adhering strictly to any code or doctrine.

## Chaotic good
Chaotic Good creatures follow their own sense of right and wrong, caring little for how others view their actions. They aren't constrained by laws, rules, or societal expectations, choosing instead to act according to their personal moral compass.

## Lawful neutral
Lawful Neutral creatures follow a code of behavior, tradition, or law, whether it comes from an external source like society or religion, or one they've created for themselves. Their actions are guided more by order and structure than by concepts of good or evil.

## Neutral
Neutral creatures tend to choose whatever seems like the best option in the moment, often acting based on immediate needs or desires rather than a defined moral philosophy. They may lack strong convictions, be indecisive, or simply not care enough to take a firm stance.

## Chaotic neutral
Chaotic Neutral creatures follow their own whims, placing personal freedom and self-interest above rules, expectations, or authority. While they generally resist being told what to do and ignore societal norms, they aren’t necessarily malicious—they just feel no strong obligation to help others.

## Lawful evil
Lawful Evil creatures follow a strict code or set of rules, but their actions are ultimately driven by self-interest. They often seek power and control, using structure and order as tools to serve their own ambitions—frequently acting as tyrants, or aspiring to be.

## Neutral evil
Neutral Evil creatures are driven by self-interest and will do whatever they can get away with to benefit themselves. They may follow rules when it’s convenient, but they feel no real loyalty to them—and while they can be ruthless, they tend to be more calculated and less erratic than their Chaotic Evil counterparts.

## Chaotic evil
Chaotic Evil creatures act on impulsive, often malicious desires, driven by selfishness and greed. They tend to be violent, disregard the needs of others, and ignore all rules or expectations. These beings rarely submit to authority—unless forced to by fear or power.
